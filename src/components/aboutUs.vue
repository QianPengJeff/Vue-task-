        <p>
          My Name is Qian Peng. I finished my master degree in information technology at Federation University Australia in 2014, after that, I got my first job as a Web/UI designer at iSmart Mobile Business Solutions. During the time at iSmart, I successfully designed the UI of a range of products which lead to repeat business and completed the company website within the specified deadline and received positive feedback. I got my second front-end developer job at Kinnov Pty Ltd, which is also an Australian company. I finished the online ordering website/APP project by using the angularJs and ionic1 framework. I also used a real-time database called firebase as the backend. I also learned the angular2 and ionic2 by myself and finished my own project called AirportMate.

            Basically, I have 2 years web/front-end work experience in Melbourne,
            and now Iâ€™m a permanent resident of Australia.I regard myself as a self-motivated, team player that can also work individually when required. I also have experience in learning new technologies as needed.
